Wikipedia case study: This case study examines the evolution and operational aspects of Wikipedia, a globally renowned online encyclopedia. It delves into Wikipedia's developmental models, licensing, mode of funding, and its interplay with commercial and non-commercial use. By analyzing these key facets, this study provides insights into the sustainability and impact of this open-access knowledge platform.

Developmental Models: Wikipedia's developmental model is a unique blend of crowdsourced content creation and community-driven governance. Contributors worldwide collaborate to create and edit articles on a vast array of topics. The model's success lies in its ability to harness the wisdom of the crowd and maintain a relatively high standard of quality through self-policing mechanisms, such as talk pages and the Wikimedia Foundation's guidelines.

Licensing: Wikipedia content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA) license. This open licensing model allows anyone to reuse, remix, and redistribute Wikipedia's content as long as they provide proper attribution and share derivative works under the same license. This licensing choice reflects Wikipedia's commitment to free and open knowledge dissemination.

Mode of Funding: Wikipedia's funding primarily comes from donations from individuals and philanthropic organizations. It runs annual fundraising campaigns that encourage users to contribute financially to support its operations. Wikipedia's commitment to remaining ad-free and independent is a testament to its dedication to providing unbiased information.

Commercial/Non-Commercial Use: While Wikipedia's content is freely accessible and usable by anyone, it is predominantly used for non-commercial purposes, such as research, education, and personal knowledge enrichment. However, some commercial entities incorporate Wikipedia content into their products and services, often with attribution and adherence to the CC BY-SA license. This raises questions about the balance between commercial utilization and the platform's nonprofit ethos.
